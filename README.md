LibM2
=====
A library to help extend and develop new features for Metin2 servers

Requires [Boost](http://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/) (version >= 1.41 & < 1.48 if you want to use the unordered_map class, otherwise any should work)

Also requires a C++11 compatible compiler (e.g. gcc >= 4.8)

Requires mysql headers and must be linked against mysql to use any of the mysql_* functions (as I was too lazy to manually implement them)

More documentation comming soonâ„¢.
